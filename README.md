kropaya
=======

A fantasy language, unhindered by reality.

Ur-Principle: Like [Atomish](https://github.com/flaviusb/Atomish), but starting from first class labels and row polymorphism instead of starting from message sends to activatable cells.

Does this even make sense? I am not yet sure.

Is it any good?
---------------

At the moment, no. There is no running code at all.

Project Organisation
--------------------

Each subfolder has it's own `README.md` detailing relevant things.

The proect is licensed under the GPLv3; details in `LICENSE`. Vendored files are available under their own licenses, which are listed either at the root of their vendored directory or at the top of each file.

Installing instractions will eventually be in `INSTALL.md`.

General project layout explanations are in `LAYOUT.md`.

My assorted noodling and ill-considered thoughts at any given time about the project are in `scratch.md`.

General syntax and semantics of the language are in `kropaya.md`.
